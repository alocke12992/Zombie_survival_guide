Although starting a bug out bag prior to SHTF it is good to continually add supplies to your stash.

When creating an EOWP, you and your group need to decide on a place or location where everyone needs to meet if they are separated during the initial outbreak. This location can be someone’s house, a small store, a hidden location or landmark known only to those in the group. If possible try to have your meeting location outside the city but if necessary you can even meet in a small park. When deciding where to meet try to avoid areas with large amounts of people such as downtown, a Walmart or mall. This is because, more people there are means a few things might happen: either you will not be able to find everyone in your group and/or there is a greater chance of that place being overrun much faster than places with few people. Keep in mind one or two back up locations the everyone can meet at incase someone is not able to make it to the original location. When deciding these secondary locations follow the same guidelines as discussed before and make them in the same general area with maybe a mile or two difference. For example, you do not want one location to be north of the city and the other on the far south. This will keep from having to track back across the dangerous city just to meet up with the crew.",image:"https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_660,h_300/https://knowpreparesurvive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SHTF-survival-plan-660x300.png"},{id:3,page:"Maps",title:"Maps",content:"Assuming your meeting location is outside the city another step in creating a plan is having an evacuation arrangement.

There should only be one or two entrances to the compound, both should be heavily fortified. Perimeter walls can be made out of brick or steel plates that can withstand lots of force. In addition, you need easy access to weapons so having an armory is essential.

Having space for day to day endeavors such as farming and leisure activities is essential to a lasting and successful compound. When farming space is needed for gardens and livestock, both of these areas need to be used for food and other natural occurring resources. Although not a lot is required it is good to have some space that can be used to play games such as football or other physical activities to help maintain good physiological order for all members.

The only times when going outside the compound is when a rescue mission is required, when you must get supplies for the community or the compound is starting to get overrun. Gathering supplies is a must when everyone has gone through their bug out bags and crops have not yet started to grow. Small convenience stores and gas stations are great places to locate food and other basic supplies while still avoiding large groups of people. If necessary find a small medical clinic or pharmacy to retrieve medical supplies such as bandages, disinfectants and various medications. When leaving the compound stay in groups as much as possible. If you are to encounter a horde of zombies while outside the protection of the compound it is easier to defend them when you have someone that can defend your back and vice versa.

If you are taking a pickup try to keep the bed covered as to protect materials from the weather and zombies.
