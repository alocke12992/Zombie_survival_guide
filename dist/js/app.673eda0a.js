Although this will be discussed more in depth later, bugout bags need essential tools to help survive and plans need to contain meeting locations, escape routes and how to attain your bugout bag. Bug out bags are bags that will help you survive for the first few days while chaos ensues around you. Items in an initial bugout out bag can be found at most camping and sporting good stores. Although starting a bug out bag prior to SHTF it is good to continually add supplies to your stash. The following items are the most important when creating your initial bugout bag. *Bugout bags will only be necessary if you are not able to meet with the rest of your crew and or cannot not set up a proper camp*"},{id:2,page:"EOWP",title:"Create your EOWP",content:"One more important thing to add to your bug out bag is a hard copy of your End of the World Plan, or EOWP. When creating an EOWP, you and your group need to decide on a place or location where everyone needs to meet if they are separated during the initial outbreak. This location can be someone’s house, a small store, a hidden location or landmark known only to those in the group. If possible try to have your meeting location outside the city but if necessary you can even meet in a small park. When deciding where to meet try to avoid areas with large amounts of people such as downtown, a Walmart or mall. This is because, more people there are means a few things might happen: either you will not be able to find everyone in your group and/or there is a greater chance of that place being overrun much faster than places with few people. Keep in mind one or two back up locations the everyone can meet at incase someone is not able to make it to the original location. When deciding these secondary locations follow the same guidelines as discussed before and make them in the same general area with maybe a mile or two difference. For example, you do not want one location to be north of the city and the other on the far south. This will keep from having to track back across the dangerous city just to meet up with the crew."},{id:3,page:"Maps",title:"Maps",content:"Assuming your meeting location is outside the city another step in creating a plan is having an evacuation arrangement. When creating this arrangement have a map of the city or location you are at and draw out routes that can be taken to the various meeting locations. The most optimal routes are those that have very little traffic such as back roads. Once again avoiding large groups of people is smart because looters tend to bring unnecessary trouble."},{id:4,page:"Base Camp",title:"Securing a Base Camp",content:"Once you have met up with the rest of your crew you will need to set up a secure base camp. This camp can be in the same location as the meeting place, but needs to have an acre or two as well as must be able to be easily guarded. An optimal base will be a house in the country with very strong walls as a strong barrier around the perimeter. There should only be one or two entrances to the compound, both should be heavily fortified. Perimeter walls can be made out of brick or steel plates that can withstand lots of force. In addition, you need easy access to weapons so having an armory is essential. If your team gets to be large enough to have people in multiple houses the armory is a good place to hold community meetings as well as communal meals."},{id:5,page:"Armory",title:"Armory",content:"The armory can also be a great storage place for essential supplies such as guns, explosives, tools (both gardening and home improvement tools we will discuss this later), extra melee weapons, and even stockpiles of food and medicine. Have a member of the society overwatch the armory at all times. This person should be responsible for issuing out and managing weapons for trips, food rations, and other tools. Having space for day to day endeavors such as farming and leisure activities is essential to a lasting and successful compound. When farming space is needed for gardens and livestock, both of these areas need to be used for food and other natural occurring resources. Although not a lot is required it is good to have some space that can be used to play games such as football or other physical activities to help maintain good physiological order for all members. Places such as prisons or small schools will work best for compounds. Both of these locations have strong walls, many rooms and exterior yards surrounded by fences that can easily be reinforced."},{id:6,page:"Alt-Bases",title:"Alternate Bases",content:"If for some reason you are not able to meet up with your team and get to camp, take your bug out bag and stay in your house. Barricade all exterior doors using furniture such as dressers, large electrical appliances, cabinets or any other large and heavy objects that we difficult to move. Use any scrap wood that may be found in your backyard to barricade the windows, once that is done use sheets and curtains to blackout all windows. Have one window or door with barricades that can be moved to use as an exit if necessary. Although this is not the most optimal option, staying in your house will help you survive until you can meet with your team."},{id:7,page:"Supply Runs",title:"Supply Runs; Leaving the Compound",content:"Finally leaving base should only be done when absolutely necessary. If and when this is done only a few people should go. The group that goes ought to be confident with a gun and can defend themselves. Some of those you assign to guard the perimeter are great examples of who to send out on trips. The only times when going outside the compound is when a rescue mission is required, when you must get supplies for the community or the compound is starting to get overrun. Gathering supplies is a must when everyone has gone through their bug out bags and crops have not yet started to grow. Small convenience stores and gas stations are great places to locate food and other basic supplies while still avoiding large groups of people. If necessary find a small medical clinic or pharmacy to retrieve medical supplies such as bandages, disinfectants and various medications. When leaving the compound stay in groups as much as possible. If you are to encounter a horde of zombies while outside the protection of the compound it is easier to defend them when you have someone that can defend your back and vice versa. Having more numbers means there are less zombies that need to be killed by each person. Furthermore, having more people means there are more people to help is some gets in trouble and is not able to defend themselves."},{id:8,page:"Transportation",title:"Transportation",content:"So, you have your mission, and your group but you may ask to yourself “How do I get there?”, this is where vehicles come into play. The varying type of missions requires different vehicles. If the mission is not that far away, does not require to carry or transport large loads, or a large number of a group everyone going should ride a bicycle. Bicycles should be used for a variety of reasons these include: They are quiet which will not attract zombies, they are light and can be carried if necessary, they help save on valuable resources such as fuel. If the mission is a supply run for a lot of supplies it might be necessary to take a SUV or pickup. Both of these types of vehicles can carry a lot of material. If you are taking a pickup try to keep the bed covered as to protect materials from the weather and zombies. But if the mission is escaping the compound due to it being overrun it is good to take something like a bus or RV as these vehicles can carry a lot of people and have lots of power to help making it through semi rough terrain. All vehicles should be parked inside the compound for easy access and maintenance. Vehicles should also be parked facing the exit incase a quick escape is ever required."}],about:[{id:1,link:"https://www.rei.com/blog/social/infographic-13-essential-tools-for-surviving-a-zombie-outbreak"},{id:2,link:"https://youtu.be/uPx2DT49yMg"},{id:3,link:"https://allthatsinteresting.com/survive-zombie-apocalypse"},{id:4,link:"https://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2011/05/preparedness-101-zombie-apocalypse/"},{id:5,link:"https://www.amazon.com/Large-Street-Road-Lawrence-Kansas/dp/B002UM80LW"}],items:[{id:1,title:"First
